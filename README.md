# goit-algo-hw-04

Comparing results from merge, insertion and Timsort:
- insertion method was the slowest method,
- Timsort (using built-in sorted() function) was the fastest method,
- for small amounts of data, the differences are not that significant,
- the more data, the differences begin to speak in favor of Timsort and against insertion sort,
- the merge sort is also really fast, but comparing to the Timsort (combination of insertion and merge sort) is significantly slower,
- if there is no need for specific method (with the special order of data) the default sorting function should be always used.
